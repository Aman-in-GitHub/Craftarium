# Craftarium - Code Editor 

Craftarium is a code editing website designed to provide a seamless coding experience for web developers. With Craftarium, you can write, edit, and test your code in real time without the hassle of opening and closing your browser a million times.

The tech stack I used for this project is HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla Javascript, and Vite as the package bundler.
